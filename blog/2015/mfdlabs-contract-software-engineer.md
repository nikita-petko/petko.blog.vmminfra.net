title: April 2015 - MFDLABS Networking Contractor
description: How I worked at MFDLABS as a contractor

# The beginning

In April 2015, I was approached by my long-time friend, Jakob Valara, about a job opportunity at MFDLABS. I didn't have work, but I had major experience in the software engineering field.

Jakob was a Senior Security Operations Engineer at MFDLABS. While he wasn't working on the networking team, he played a key role in the development of the MFDLABS network.

Jakob told me that a position on the networking team just opened up, and they were looking for anyone with a bit of experience in software engineering. Me being me, with no job and a lot of experience in the software engineering field, I was able to fit in.

What surprised me was how quickly I was able to get into the job. Then I soon realised that it was a contract job.

# The first day

On my first day, I knew nobody else in the team. But everyone seemed avid to introduce themselves.

2 people significantly stuck with me:
- Leighton Kavanagh
- Alex Bk√≤rdan

They seemed to show me the ropes for how everything works and functions.

I got insights on what I would be doing from our team-lead, Yaakov.

I was told I would be working with pre-existing code, helping improve and refactor it.

# The code.

When I saw what I'd be working with, I was beginning to question whether or not my decision to join the team was right.
But I could also see why they wanted this to be refactored.

A lot of it was basing off legacy systems, and looked almost unmaintainable. I tried to scramble together a list of things that would need to be moved around.
